## Overview

The **Single Genotype Circuit Model** combines Notch signaling with the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) to create a spatiotemporal framework for cellular self-organization. This approach models tissue morphogenesis by considering a mixture of mechanistic biological processes and data-driven learning.

However, traditional numerical ODE solvers become computationally expensive when dealing with large cell populations and nonlinear equations. This project addresses this challenge by **replacing numerical ODE solvers with neural network-based approximations**, combining the interpretability of mechanistic models with the efficiency of deep learning.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Accelerate simulations of tissue morphogenesis using neural network surrogates
- Maintain biological interpretability while improving computational efficiency
- Integrate Bayesian approaches for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification
- Provide a framework for hybrid mechanistic-ML modeling in developmental biology
